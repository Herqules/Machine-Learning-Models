# Machine Learning Models

This repository is a curated collection of advanced machine learning models, designed and implemented during my senior year. It includes a range of models suitable for a variety of applications, from straightforward regression analyses to sophisticated deep learning tasks. The models are developed to deliver precision and robustness in real-world scenarios.

## Overview

The project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms to solve challenging problems in data analysis and prediction. Each model is crafted with attention to data preprocessing, model architecture design, parameter tuning, and validation to ensure the business-level performance.

## Contents

- **Backpropagation.py**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks.
- **CensusDataSet.py**: Processes and prepares census data for analysis.
- **DatasetRetrieval.py**: Script for downloading and cleaning datasets.
- **DifferentialEvolution.py**: An optimization algorithm script based on the differential evolution strategy.
- **EvolutionaryStrategies.py**: Contains implementations of various evolutionary algorithms for optimization.
- **ExperimentalAI.py**: A testing ground for experimental AI concepts and models.
- **MaskedAIErrorChecking.py**: Error checking utilities for models using masked AI techniques.
- **StockAI.py**: Machine learning models specific to stock market prediction.

## Installation and Dependencies
